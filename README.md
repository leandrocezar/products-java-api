### Technologies used

This project was developed with:

* **Java 8**
* **Spring Boot 2.5.2**
* **Maven**
* **JUnit 5**
* **H2**
* **Swagger 3.0.0**
* **Model Mapper 2.3.9**

### Compile and Package

The API also was developed to run with an `jar`. In order to generate this `jar`, you should run:

```bash
mvn package
```

This command will clean, compile and generate a `jar` at target directory, e.g. `prodcts-java-api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

### Execution

This project uses **H2 database**. This database run in memory and create database, tables and populate it on turn on the application. This database run in the memory of the machine.

### Test

* For unit test phase, you can run:

```bash
mvn test
```

### Run

In order to run the API, run the jar as following:

```bash
java -jar products-java-api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev
```
    
or

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
```

By default, the API will be available at [http://localhost:999](http://localhost:9999)
